A diagnostic center wants a software which will help them generate medical reports. 
Before signing the contract, they want us to develop a sample software in order to convince 
them that we will be able to build the entire application. 

Implement a class callled BPRecord. It should have 2 attriutes callled systolic and diastollic. 
It should have a method callled generateReport, which will print the following. 
- BP value 
- High/Low/Normal BP

BP is regarded as high if systolic is greater than 140 or diastolic is greater than 90.
BP is regarded as low if systolic is less than 90 or diastolic is less than 60.
Otherwise BP is regarded as Normal.

Example 1:
Input:
130
85

Output:
Blood Pressure is 130.85
Diagnosis: Normal BP

Example 2:
Input:
145
85

Output:
Blood Pressure is 145/85
Diagnosis: High BP
